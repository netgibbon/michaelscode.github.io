# Pherian
was the first game where I took on a production role within a company. It was designed to be a large scale interactive fiction experience built using Unity and a custom JSON parser I called StoryBook.

The game took place in the fantasy world of Casan where a kingdom of animal people is under peril from the power of a recently re-discovered ancient artifact. This game was published by Studio DragonWolf on Itch.io but It has since been removed from the site due to the property being taken over by Soft Boiled Elk who will be remaking it in the future.

I have licence to produce this work on this portfolio site from first party owners.

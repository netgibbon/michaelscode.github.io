# KwikWriter

KwikWriter is a GPL-3 authoring tool in semi-active production designed to make the process of writing a novel, song, or game design document more relaxed, streamlined, and distraction-free. KwikWriter still has a way to go before it can be considered a finished product, but what is currently available isn't bad as a starting point. The front end and backend for this program can be found in the code samples section of my portfolio.

Software / tech used:
* Visual Studio
* C#
* WPF

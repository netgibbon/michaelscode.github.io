# Code samples

These are soom cool code samples for things I've made in the past. Please note that this is not full project source code, just interesting and well documented snippets. Most, if not all, of these samples are written in C# as Unity is the tool that I use the most but there may be some samples in C, Python, and JavaScript sprinkled around somewhere within.

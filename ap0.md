# AP0 (AP-Zero)
was my final year college project. We were given a brief by a "client" which stated we had to produce a prototype for a game that lasted over a minute.

The brief stated that the prototype had to run on Windows and it had to be 2D. I negotiated the use of pre-rendered 3D scenes to add atmosphere to my first person point and click adventure game and I believe that it turned out well.

For this project, I extended the AGS engine to allow me to put high-resolution "rooms" into the game, something which is now supported as standard, as well as a VST effect plugin that I called Fuzz-E. It simulated the cracks and pops you would find on a dusty vinyl record.

I still maintain Mike's AGS from time to time as it is a fork of the open source AGS engine by Chris Jones.

Tools used:
* Mike's Adventure Game Studio (MAGS)
* Autodesk 3DS Max
* Adobe Photoshop
* Visual Studio
* Git
* Butler

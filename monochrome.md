# Monochrome
was another first person point and click adventure game styled after 1940's and 1950's detective noire. It was made in collaboration with my brother who worked on the art. I designed an interactive main menu styled after the office of a P.I where each object was interactable and opened up a menu option. It was quite fun to work on this, it's just a shame that it never saw the light of day.

This game took advantage of the extensions that I made to the AGS engine for AP0, as well as a real-time lighting plugin that was supposed to be used for character shadows and swinging lights in interrogation scenes that,  unfurtnately, is not supported by the most recent versions of AGS or, by extension, Mike's AGS.

Tools used:
* Mike's Adventure Game Studio (MAGS)
* Visual Studio
* Ableton Live

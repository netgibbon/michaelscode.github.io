I've been a computer programmer since I was about six years old. Both my parents were software engineers and were heavily involved in the development of embedded systems and video games from the early 80's through to the late 90's. Seeing as none of my siblings were interested, they hoped I'd catch the bug by getting me into C++, 68k Assembly, Java, and Computer hardware. It seems to have been a success and some of it has stuck around in my head long enough for me to do something with it. The majority of my work is made for modern systems but if I find a decent way to show some of my CP/M, Amiga, or Amstrad programs then it will also end up here becuse a lot of it is pretty cool

This website is a small collection of the following:
* Games I've made
* Desktop applications I've made
* Code samples

My journey as a software engineer has been a very fun winding path that's put me in a variety of roles. I can't wait to see what we make together.
